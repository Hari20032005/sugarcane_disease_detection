# üåæ Complete Beginner's Guide to Running Sugarcane Disease Detection System

This guide will help you run the sugarcane disease detection system step by step, even if you're completely new to programming.

## üìã What You Need to Install First

### Step 1: Install Python (for Backend)
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.11 or newer
3. **IMPORTANT**: During installation, check the box "Add Python to PATH"
4. Click "Install Now"
5. Test installation: Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and type:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like "Python 3.11.x"

### Step 2: Install Node.js (for Frontend)
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS version (recommended)
3. Install with default settings
4. Test installation: In Command Prompt/Terminal, type:
   ```
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   You should see version numbers for both

## üöÄ Running the System

### Step 3: Open Command Prompt/Terminal
- **Windows**: Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

### Step 4: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
# Replace this path with where you saved the project
cd path/to/sugarcane-disease-detection

# For example, if it's on your Desktop:
# Windows: cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\sugarcane-disease-detection
# Mac/Linux: cd ~/Desktop/sugarcane-disease-detection
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Backend (Python Server)

#### 5a. Navigate to Backend Folder
```bash
cd backend
```

#### 5b. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 5c. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*This might take a few minutes to download and install all packages*

#### 5d. Start the Backend Server
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**‚úÖ Success Signs:**
- You should see messages like "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"
- No error messages
- **Keep this window open!** The backend is now running.

### Step 6: Set Up the Frontend (React Website)

#### 6a. Open a NEW Command Prompt/Terminal Window
*Don't close the backend window - open a new one*

#### 6b. Navigate to Frontend Folder
```bash
# Go back to main project folder first
cd path/to/sugarcane-disease-detection
cd frontend
```

#### 6c. Install Frontend Packages
```bash
npm install
```
*This might take a few minutes*

#### 6d. Start the Frontend Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

**‚úÖ Success Signs:**
- You should see "Local: http://localhost:5173"
- No error messages
- **Keep this window open too!**

## üéâ Access Your Application

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
2. Go to: **http://localhost:5173**
3. You should see the Sugarcane Disease Detection website!

## üß™ Testing the System

1. **Select Disease Type**: Choose "Dead Heart" or "Tiller"
2. **Upload Image**: Click to upload any image (for testing)
3. **Fill Questionnaire**: Answer the 15 yes/no questions
4. **Click "Analyze Disease"**: See the results!

## ‚ùå Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem: "python is not recognized"
**Solution**: Python wasn't added to PATH during installation
- Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
- Or search "Environment Variables" in Windows and add Python to PATH

### Problem: "npm is not recognized"
**Solution**: Node.js wasn't installed properly
- Reinstall Node.js from nodejs.org
- Restart your computer after installation

### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Something is already using the port
- Close other applications
- Or change the port number:
  ```bash
  # For backend, use different port:
  python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
  
  # For frontend, it will automatically suggest a different port
  ```

### Problem: Backend shows "Model not found" warnings
**Solution**: This is normal! The system works with mock data for testing
- To use real models, add your .pt and .joblib files to the `models/` folder

### Problem: Can't access http://localhost:5173
**Solution**: 
- Make sure both backend and frontend are running
- Check if your firewall is blocking the ports
- Try http://127.0.0.1:5173 instead

## üõë How to Stop the System

1. **Stop Frontend**: In the frontend terminal, press `Ctrl + C`
2. **Stop Backend**: In the backend terminal, press `Ctrl + C`
3. **Deactivate Virtual Environment** (if you used one):
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## üìÅ Project Structure (What Each Folder Does)

```
sugarcane-disease-detection/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/           # Python server (AI processing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/          # React website (user interface)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/            # Your AI model files go here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # Sample data for testing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Detailed documentation
```

## üÜò Need More Help?

1. **Check the main README.md** for detailed technical information
2. **Look at the examples/ folder** for sample data
